Build the fire and gather 'round the trees 
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me 
So kiss me under the mistletoe 
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snowâ€¦ 
Build the fire and gather 'round the trees 
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to this song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone
Ah-ah, ah-ahAh-ah, ah-ah
So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
I feel it when it comes
Every year helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends
Are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
It's Christmastime for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmastime for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmastime for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmastime for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time
